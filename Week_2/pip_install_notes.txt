Pip - pip installs packages
pip tries to download 3rd-party packages from PyPl (the main 3rd party repo for python packages)

packages that are downloaded are saved to your python library, but it is common practice to create a virtual environment for any project using 3rd party packages

the virtual environment will have a copy of the interpretor and the library used to create it and any pip installs; all will be on the virtual environment
Any pip installs will be redirected to the virtual environemtn when the environment is activated

the command 
py -m {environmentName} to create the environment

run py -m {environmentName}
